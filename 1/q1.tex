    \section{q1}
    The while loop multiplies fac by i returning it to itself then prints fac and i then increments
    i by one until i reaches 10. Essentially printing a pattern where the right number is multiplied by the 
    number on the next row on the left to find the next number on the right side. Hence \\
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
            1 & 1 \\
            2 & 2 \\
            3 & 6 \\
            4 & 24 \\
            5 & 120 \\
            6 & 720 \\
            7 & 5040 \\
            8 & 40320 \\
            9 & 362880
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Since i reaches 10 before it is multiplied by fac the while loop ends and a row with i as 10 does not get printed.
    \section{q2}
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{./1_2.py}
    Here we see a some code the loops over a print statement mutating the variable i each time, starting from 1 and going to 10.
    The print statement print the value, it's square and it's cube.
    \section{q3}
    The answers are m and 3 since the 4th letter of the 3rd to last element of the list b is m and the first entry in a is 3.
    \section{q4} 
    $1e^{3}$ will take a short time but is less accurate than $1e^{26}$, but $1e^{26}$ takes a long time. $1e^{7}$ is accurate enought while being still relatively fast.

    \begin{code}
        4.53988% are outside of the range -2 < x < 2
    \end{code}
    With obviously some variation in percentage calcuated, however to minimise this the code is ran "repeats" number of times and an average is found.
    \section{q8}
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{./1_8.py}
    Here we change the code given to us from a set number of runs "n" to a stopping condition, in this case I chose $1e^{-7}$ since it resulted in a reasonable amount of precision.
    Here we output the result as:
    \begin{code}
        1051.2492201029809
    \end{code}
